==========================================
  AI-Powered Quiz System - Setup Guide
==========================================

WHAT YOU'VE BUILT:
------------------
✓ Quiz application with Biology, Chemistry, and Physics questions
✓ AI analyzer that examines quiz results
✓ Personalized recommendations based on performance
✓ Study plan generator
✓ Strengths and weaknesses identification


QUICK START:
------------
1. Double-click "start_servers.bat" to start both servers
2. Open browser and go to: http://localhost:8000/STUDENTHOME.html
3. Take the quiz and submit answers
4. View Results page to see AI-generated recommendations


MANUAL START (if batch file doesn't work):
-------------------------------------------
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install flask flask-cors

2. Start AI API Server (in Terminal 1):
   python api_server.py

3. Start Web Server (in Terminal 2):
   python -m http.server 8000

4. Open browser: http://localhost:8000/STUDENTHOME.html


HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. Student takes quiz and submits answers
2. Results are saved in browser localStorage
3. Results page automatically calls AI API
4. AI analyzes performance and generates:
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Study plan with time allocation
   - Strengths identification
   - Weaknesses with action plans
5. Everything displays beautifully on Results page


FILES CREATED:
--------------
- ai_analyzer.py      : AI analysis engine
- api_server.py       : Flask API server
- requirements.txt    : Python dependencies
- start_servers.bat   : Easy startup script
- RESULTS.html        : Enhanced with AI insights (modified)
- QUIZ.html           : Saves quiz data (modified)


AI FEATURES:
------------
✓ Performance Level Assessment (Excellent/Good/Average/Needs Improvement)
✓ Subject-wise Analysis with priority levels
✓ Personalized Recommendations with action items
✓ Daily Study Plan with time allocation
✓ Weekly Goals customized to your performance
✓ Strengths and Weaknesses identification
✓ Fallback recommendations if AI API is offline


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Problem: AI recommendations not showing
Solution: Make sure both servers are running (ports 5000 and 8000)

Problem: "AI API not available" error
Solution: Check if api_server.py is running on port 5000

Problem: Results not saving
Solution: Make sure you're using http://localhost:8000 not file://

Problem: Module not found error
Solution: Run: pip install flask flask-cors


NEXT STEPS TO ENHANCE:
----------------------
1. Add more sophisticated AI models (OpenAI GPT, etc.)
2. Store student history in database
3. Generate topic-specific practice questions
4. Add progress tracking over time
5. Implement adaptive difficulty
6. Add video tutorial recommendations


SUPPORT:
--------
Check console logs (F12) for detailed debugging information
Both Quiz page and Results page have extensive logging enabled
